<h1>ToscanaJ Developer Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a short introduction for people wanting to get involved in
teh ToscanaJ development. It gives first an introduction how to get all
the stuff you need and then some hints on how to compile and run it.</p>
<h2>Getting the sources</h2>
<p>To compile and run ToscanaJ you need to get some modules from the
CVS repository on Sourceforge. First you should read the <a
 href="https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=37081">introduction to CVS</a>
on the project pages. You will need to use the developer access to
commit changes into the repository, if you just want the latest version
and don't want to commit changes (or you are happy to <a
 href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=37081&amp;atid=418906">commit
patches</a>), just use anonymous access. If you think you should have
write access, please ask on the <a
 href="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=37081">developer mailing
list</a> for it. </p>
<p>The modules you need for a standard build are: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">examples</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">libs</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">source</span>. These have to be put into
the same directory since the build script will expect them to be
colocated. You can safely ignore the other modules first, in case you
are curious read the <a
 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/toscanaj/docs/developers/cvsStructure.xml?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">XML
file describing the structure of the CVS</a>. </p>
<h2>Build tools<br>
</h2>
<p>The main build process for ToscanaJ is using the <a
 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Ant build tool</a> from the <a
 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Apache Jakarta project</a>. You just
need a standard binary distribution to compile and run ToscanaJ. At the
moment of writing the developers also use <a
 href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> (very good, Open Source) and <a
 href="http://www.intellij.com">IDEA</a> (fabulous, commercial
licencing) for development. Feel free to ask for some help on setting up
these IDEs if you need it. But any editor/IDE for Java should work, esp.
if you are willing to use Ant for the actual build process.<br>
</p>
<h2>Building with Ant</h2>
Building ToscanaJ just means running Ant while being in the toplevel
directory of the <span style="font-style: italic;">source</span> module.
This directory should contain a <span style="font-style: italic;">build.xml</span>
file with a couple of different targets. The default one just compiles
ToscanaJ, and it is invoked by just running the command <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">ant</span> without any parameters.
There are other build targets which can be given as a parameter, e.g. <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">ant run</span> will compile and run
ToscanaJ. Here is a list of all interesting targets:<br>
<dl>
  <dt>compile</dt>
  <dd>just compiles the code</dd>
  <dt>rebuild</dt>
  <dd>compiles a clean version (necessary in case dependencies are
still held by old files)</dd>
  <dt>dist</dt>
  <dd>creates a tarball with the distribution in it. This is exactly
the same format as the downloads on Sourceforge</dd>
  <dt>splitDist</dt>
  <dd>creates the distribution splitted across three files: the program
itself, the libraries and the examples. This is useful if you want to
update an installation, since the libraries and examples change far less
than the code and the file containing the program will be very small</dd>
  <dt>javadoc</dt>
  <dd>creates the JavaDoc for the program (we actually don't use that
call and there is not that much JavaDoc in the code since we rather use
descriptive names)</dd>
  <dt>run</dt>
  <dd>compiles and runs ToscanaJ</dd>
  <dt>run-elba</dt>
  <dd>compiles and runs Elba</dd>
  <dt>run-siena</dt>
  <dd>compiles and runs Siena</dd>
  <dt>run-lucca</dt>
  <dd>compiles and runs Lucca<br>
  </dd>

<h2>Using the Sourceforge system</h2>
<p>We make use of many features of the Sourceforge system. Most
importantly we use the <a
 href="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=37081">mailing lists</a>
and the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=37081">tracker
interface</a>, so if you want to be part of the development effort, you
should at least start reading the developer list and check the trackers
before asking for features or filing bug reports. Of course we rather
want duplicates than things slipping through, but you make our life
easier if you at least scan the tracker item titles before filing your
bug report or feature request.</p>
