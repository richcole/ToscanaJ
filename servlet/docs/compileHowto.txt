The ToscanaJ servlet builds upon the regular ToscanaJ code. To compile it 
you have to add both source directories, the one from ToscanaJ itself and
the one in this module to your input path.

The libraries needed should be the servlet.jar found in this module and the
jdom.jar found in the ToscanaJ libs module.
