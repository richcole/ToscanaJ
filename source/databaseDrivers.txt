This directory can contain additional database drivers which are
loaded automatically if specified by a particular CSX file. To add
a driver to ToscanaJ, make a subdirectory in this directory and put
the corresponding driver into it -- either as JAR file or the classes
themself.

Note that the subdirectory is required, JAR files in this directory
will not be scanned.

You can speed up the loading if you add a file "driver.txt" with the
name of the driver class you want to load in it. In that case ToscanaJ
does not need to check all files in a JAR if they are the driver, which
is expensive (the class has to be loaded and reflection has to be used
to see if it implements the Driver interface).
