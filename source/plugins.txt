to add extra functionality into ToscanaJ which is not required for all
systems and would increase the size of the original download signifi-
cantly. To add a plugin just extract its contents into this folder,
using the directory structure provided by the plugin.

At the moment ToscanaJ supports plugins for database viewers.
