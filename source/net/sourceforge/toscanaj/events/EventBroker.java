/**
 * A class distributing events to listeners.
 *
 * This is the central class of the Tockit event processing model. It takes
 * new events on the processEvent(Event) method and distributes them to
 * event listeners that are subscribed to this broker using
 * subscribe(EventListener, Class, Class).
 *
 * On subscription one can give two possible filter options, one to specify
 * which type of events one is interested in, the other specifies the type
 * of object one cares about. An example of usage would be subscribing to
 * only selection events on rectangles on a canvas.
 *
 * Brokers can subscribe to other brokers since they implement the listener
 * interface. This way a set of event handling contexts can be created where
 * events are passed around. Different components in a system can have their
 * own broker while one could add an additional one on the meta level
 * subscribing to the specific one and thus giving a meta-context where events
 * from different components can be observed.
 *
 * To cause processing of an event one just calls processEvent(Event) with
 * a new object implementing the Event interface. This will put the event at
 * the end of an event queue which will instantly processed. This means events
 * are processed synchronously if they are not enqueued while other events are
 * processed. If you enqueue a new event while another is still being processed
 * (i.e. as reaction on the first event), the new event will be processed after
 * the processing of the first one has finished.
