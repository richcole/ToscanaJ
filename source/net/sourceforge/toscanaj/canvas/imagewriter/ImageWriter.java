/**
 * Interface for implementing image writers.
 *
 * To add an image writer you should do these things:
 * - implement this interface by writing your encoding code
 * - use the singleton approach to get one static instance
 * - add at least one static inner class extending GraphicFormat that defines
 *   what your image writer can handle, pointing getWriter() to your singleton
 * - write a static method initialize() that creates your singleton and calls
 *   GraphicFormatRegistry.register(GraphicFormat) for all formats you support
 * - call the latter at program startup
 *
 * Don't try to implement the registration in a generic static block, this won't
 * be called unless something else of the class is used. You don't have to supply
 * any other way to get your singleton than by calling GraphicFormat.getWriter().
