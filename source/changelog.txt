Changes between version 1.4.1 and the CVS version of the ToscanaJ 
program suite:

Affecting different programs:
=============================
- grid size now changes with a factor of third root of two. This means after
  three refinements the nodes are all on a grid location again.
- CSC import is greatly enhanced, most importantly it supports include files now.
- Bugfix: saving files with descriptions on objects or attributes works again.
- Bugfix: lines now connect properly to the corners of the labels -- in some 
  situations there was a visible offset before.
- creating lattice diagrams is now a lot faster (noticable esp. when importing
  Cernato or Burmeister files).
- the restrictions of the n-dim manipulator on diagrams created without external
  order (all but Cernato-import) are reduced -- the diagrams are enforced to be
  additive in attributes of meet-irreducible nodes, but nothing more. In naive
  terms: it doesn't behave weird anymore :-) Applies only to new diagrams, though.
  Old ones need to be recreated (e.g. by hitting "Create" in the context editor).

Specific for ToscanaJ:
======================
- the database viewer for opening documents (ShellExectuteDatabaseViewewr) now
  starts external programs in a separate Thread, thus not blocking the UI anymore.
- the HTMLDatabaseViewer does support giving a title in the way typical for HTML
  (<html>/<head>/<title>). This is used as the dialog title for the views created.
- a new database viewer called "InfoDatabaseViewer" allows showing plain text or
  HTML found either directly in the database or via a URL found in the database
- Bugfix: when changing diagram schemas, the background can be erased again.
- result lists from the database can now be sorted using an ORDER BY on each column
  used (in the given order). This can be turned on in the preferences.

Specific for Elba:
==================
- Elba can now connect to Excel files directly, using a new option in the DB
  connection dialog. This avoids having to set up a data source manually.
- before creating a speed optimized system Elba will check if the schema has
  been saved.
- Elba warns before creating a speed optimized system that this changes the
  database and the conceptual schema.
- the table/key pair for the DB connection now gets selected via two combo
  boxes (should be more intuitive).
- after setting up the DB connection, a popup notifies the user about the
  success.
- Bugfix: last CSC import and last export location are remembered between program
  sessions.

Specific for Siena (still not fully complete):
==============================================
- added import of object-attribute lists (similar to ConExp: a list of objects
  with their attributes in lines of the form "obj:attr1;attr2;...").

Other new experimental features:
================================



Changes between version 1.4 and version 1.4.1 of the ToscanaJ 
program suite:

Affecting different programs:
=============================
- Bugfix: MRU menu after File->New is handled correctly now
- Bugfix: title of the window adjusts after File->New

Specific for ToscanaJ:
======================
- Bugfix: in some occasions exceptions where thrown when using SQL queries
  (lattice infimum with empty contingent)

Specific for Elba:
==================
- Bugfix: ordinal scale generation works again
- Bugfix: nominal scale generator allows re-adding values after removal from
  selection
- Bugfix: nominal scales across columns add the column names and can have the 
  same values in different columns without breaking the scale
- Bugfix: grid scale generation works again




Changes between version 1.3 and version 1.4 of the ToscanaJ 
program suite:

Affecting different programs:
=============================
- contexts do have a notion of object and attribute order now,
  which they remember, the order can be changed using the context
  menus in the context editor
- instead of having some color modes, five color schemas can now be
  selected: the four corresponding to the color modes, with a
  duplication of the default one: one of these will stay with default
  values, the other one gets the values changed in the preferences
  dialog
- the order of objects and attributes in the context will be remembered,
  even after saving and loading a CSX file
- bugfix: the diagram export dialog now remembers the last export 
  position properly (was broken during session and in between sessions
  if the exported file was deleted)
- the Save As... dialog now uses the location of the current file
- when exporting diagrams a new option allows setting a background
  color, which will also be used in formats otherwise supporting a
  transparent background. This can be useful if the program used to
  import e.g. a PNG into can not handle the transparency properly

Specific for ToscanaJ:
======================
- the tooltip on the labels and nodes, showing the intent and extent
  of the concept, has been replaced with a non-modal dialog, which can
  be opened to show the same information for the concept underneath
  the mouse (the tooltip was found distracting by many users)

Specific for Elba:
==================
- bugfix: export object and attribute lists with Tools->Export Realized 
  Scales... works again
- bugfix: most recently used files are available even if loading the last
  one failed

Specific for Siena (still not fully complete):
==============================================
- many-valued contexts imported from Cernato XML can be seen (and
  edited, but this is not finished and will not affect anything yet)
- transition arrow styles have extra option to change the width of
  the border line
- three query types are allowed: count, list, distribution (as in
  the ToscanaJ defaults)
- diagram labels and contexts based on the Cernato import feature will
  use the same order as in the imported many-valued context
- arrow styles are now maintained with the diagram color schema, and 
  thus stored in the session management, i.e they are remembered when
  closing and reopening Siena. This also means that changing the schema
  implies changing the arrow styles, although this is not instantly
  visible (some repaints missing) and the standard settings for the
  grayscale and black&white are not yet adjusted -- this can be done by
  the user and will be remembered.
- bugfix: most recently used files are available even if loading the last
  one failed
- if Cernato diagrams fail to be created (can happen if the XML file is
  inconsistent), an error message will appear and the following diagrams
  will still be created if possible
  



Changes between versions 1.2 and 1.3 version of the ToscanaJ 
program suite:

Affecting all programs:
=======================
- diagram views now have tooltips on the nodes, showing intent and
  extent
- the image writers using libraries have been outsourced into plugins,
  thus reducing the download size reasonably
- the user settings and session managment now use Java's Preferences
  API, which means we don't rely on write access to the installation
  directory anymore and multi-user systems should now store the settings
  on a per-user basis
- look and feels can be loaded via plugins

ToscanaJ:
=========
- the preferences can now be edited with a GUI

Elba:
=====

Siena (still not fully complete):
=================================
- the temporal controls are now officially part of the program and
  can be toggled from the view menu. They appear below the diagram
  list now in a redesigned layout
- the color and style of the arrows can be edited
- arrow setups are saved and loaded

Other new experimental features:
================================
