Changes between version 1.3 and the CVS version of the ToscanaJ 
program suite:

Affecting different programs:
=============================
- contexts do have a notion of object and attribute order now,
  which they remember, the order can be changed using the context
  menus in the context editor

Specific for ToscanaJ:
======================
- the tooltip on the labels and nodes, showing the intent and extent
  of the concept, has been replaced with a non-modal dialog, which can
  be opened to show the same information for the concept underneath
  the mouse (the tooltip was found distracting by many users)

Specific for Elba:
==================

Specific for Siena (still not fully complete):
==============================================
- the way grayscale and black&white views are created has been
  changed to cover all visual objects (affects transition arrows)
- many-valued contexts imported from Cernato XML can be seen (and
  edited, but this is not finished and will not affect anything yet)
- transition arrow styles have extra option to change the width of
  the border line
- three query types are allowed: count, list, distribution (as in
  the ToscanaJ defaults)
- diagrams based on the Cernato import feature will use the same order
  in the labels as in the imported many-valued context
  

Other new experimental features:
================================





Changes between versions 1.2 and 1.3 version of the ToscanaJ 
program suite:

Affecting all programs:
=======================
- diagram views now have tooltips on the nodes, showing intent and
  extent
- the image writers using libraries have been outsourced into plugins,
  thus reducing the download size reasonably
- the user settings and session managment now use Java's Preferences
  API, which means we don't rely on write access to the installation
  directory anymore and multi-user systems should now store the settings
  on a per-user basis
- look and feels can be loaded via plugins

ToscanaJ:
=========
- the preferences can now be edited with a GUI

Elba:
=====

Siena (still not fully complete):
=================================
- the temporal controls are now officially part of the program and
  can be toggled from the view menu. They appear below the diagram
  list now in a redesigned layout
- the color and style of the arrows can be edited
- arrow setups are saved and loaded

Other new experimental features:
================================
