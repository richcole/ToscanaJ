Changes between version 1.3 and the CVS version of the ToscanaJ 
program suite:

Affecting all programs:
=======================
- contexts do have a notion of object and attribute order now,
  which they remember

ToscanaJ:
=========

Elba:
=====

Siena (still not fully complete):
=================================
- the way grayscale and black&white views are created has been
  changed to cover all visual objects (affects transition arrows)
- many-valued contexts imported from Cernato XML can be seen (and
  edited, but this is not finished and will not affect anything yet)
- transition arrow styles have extra option to change the width of
  the border line

Other new experimental features:
================================





Changes between versions 1.2 and 1.3 version of the ToscanaJ 
program suite:

Affecting all programs:
=======================
- diagram views now have tooltips on the nodes, showing intent and
  extent
- the image writers using libraries have been outsourced into plugins,
  thus reducing the download size reasonably
- the user settings and session managment now use Java's Preferences
  API, which means we don't rely on write access to the installation
  directory anymore and multi-user systems should now store the settings
  on a per-user basis
- look and feels can be loaded via plugins

ToscanaJ:
=========
- the preferences can now be edited with a GUI

Elba:
=====

Siena (still not fully complete):
=================================
- the temporal controls are now officially part of the program and
  can be toggled from the view menu. They appear below the diagram
  list now in a redesigned layout
- the color and style of the arrows can be edited
- arrow setups are saved and loaded

Other new experimental features:
================================
