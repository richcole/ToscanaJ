Changes between version 1.3 and the CVS version of the ToscanaJ 
program suite:

Affecting different programs:
=============================
- contexts do have a notion of object and attribute order now,
  which they remember, the order can be changed using the context
  menus in the context editor
- instead of having some color modes, five color schemas can now be
  selected: the four corresponding to the color modes, with a
  duplication of the default one: one of these will stay with default
  values, the other one gets the values changed in the preferences
  dialog

Specific for ToscanaJ:
======================
- the tooltip on the labels and nodes, showing the intent and extent
  of the concept, has been replaced with a non-modal dialog, which can
  be opened to show the same information for the concept underneath
  the mouse (the tooltip was found distracting by many users)

Specific for Elba:
==================
- bugfix: export object and attribute lists with Tools->Export Realized 
  Scales... works again
- bugfix: most recently used files are available even if loading the last
  one failed

Specific for Siena (still not fully complete):
==============================================
- many-valued contexts imported from Cernato XML can be seen (and
  edited, but this is not finished and will not affect anything yet)
- transition arrow styles have extra option to change the width of
  the border line
- three query types are allowed: count, list, distribution (as in
  the ToscanaJ defaults)
- diagrams based on the Cernato import feature will use the same order
  in the labels as in the imported many-valued context
- arrow styles are now maintained with the diagram color schema, and 
  thus stored in the session management, i.e they are remembered when
  closing and reopening Siena. This also means that changing the schema
  implies changing the arrow styles, although this is not instantly
  visible (some repaints missing) and the standard settings for the
  grayscale and black&white are not yet adjusted -- this can be done by
  the user and will be remembered.
- bugfix: most recently used files are available even if loading the last
  one failed
  

Other new experimental features:
================================





Changes between versions 1.2 and 1.3 version of the ToscanaJ 
program suite:

Affecting all programs:
=======================
- diagram views now have tooltips on the nodes, showing intent and
  extent
- the image writers using libraries have been outsourced into plugins,
  thus reducing the download size reasonably
- the user settings and session managment now use Java's Preferences
  API, which means we don't rely on write access to the installation
  directory anymore and multi-user systems should now store the settings
  on a per-user basis
- look and feels can be loaded via plugins

ToscanaJ:
=========
- the preferences can now be edited with a GUI

Elba:
=====

Siena (still not fully complete):
=================================
- the temporal controls are now officially part of the program and
  can be toggled from the view menu. They appear below the diagram
  list now in a redesigned layout
- the color and style of the arrows can be edited
- arrow setups are saved and loaded

Other new experimental features:
================================
