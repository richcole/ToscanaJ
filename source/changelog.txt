Changes between version 1.1 and the CVS version of the ToscanaJ 
program suite:

Affecting all programs:
=======================
- labels hide their scrollbar when they don't contain the mouse
- objects and attributes in the context have an order based on
  their content's order if possible (e.g. strings are sorted
  lexicographically)
- PDF export now contains selectable text
- PDF can be exported as version 4 instead of 5
- EPS export works far better (although not as perfect as other
  vector formats)
- EMF and PPM can be exported

ToscanaJ:

Elba:

Siena (still not fully complete):
